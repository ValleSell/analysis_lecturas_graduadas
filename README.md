PLEASE FIND THE LAST UPDATES IN MY GITLAB https://gitlab.com/ValleSell/analysis_lecturas_graduadas

This is the code for my master thesis an der University of Barcelona.
I adapted the code for the paper "Content Analysis of Textbooks via Natural Language Processing" by:
> Lucy*, L., Demszky*, D., Bromley, P. & Jurafsky, D. (2019). Content Analysis of Textbooks via Natural Language Processing: Findings on Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in Texas US HistoryTextbooks.  *indicates equal contribution

You can use these scripts to perform analyses on spanish texts to better understand the representation of minorities and women in text. 

I am currently working on a tutorial. Until then, you can use Demszky's as a guide.
